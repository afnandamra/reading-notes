# Representational state transfer (REST)

**REST** is a de-facto standard for a software architecture for interactive applications that typically use multiple Web services. 

The article is a conversation about REST between two brothers, About how the web works.

1. HTTP protocol: describing the location of something anywhere in the world from anywhere in the world.
2. WWW : The whole world wide web is built on an architectural style called “REST”. REST provides a definition of a “resource”, which is what those things point to.
* A web page is a “representation” of a resource.
3. “Web Services” or "APIs" : send messages back and forth to each other.
4. Get, put, delete : HTTP applies verbs to nouns.
