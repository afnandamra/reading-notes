# DATABASE NORMALIZATION

**Database normalization** is a process used to organize a database into tables and columns. The idea is that a table should be about a specific topic and that only those columns which support that topic are included. 

### Reasons for Normalization
1. to minimize duplicate data
2. to minimize or avoid data modification issues
3. to simplify queries
