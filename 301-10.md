## JavaScript Call Slack

Data structure that uses (LIFO): When we say that the call stack, operates by the data structure principle of Last In, First Out, it means that the last function that gets pushed into the stack is the first to be pop out, when the function returns.

1. It is single-threaded. Meaning it can only do one thing at a time.
2. Code execution is synchronous.
3. A function invocation creates a stack frame that occupies a temporary memory.
4. It works as a LIFO â€” Last In, First Out data structure.


```js
function firstFunction(){
  console.log("Hello from firstFunction");
}

function secondFunction(){
  firstFunction();
  console.log("The end from secondFunction");
}

secondFunction();
```
the output for the above function will be:

```
"Hello from firstFunction"
"The end from secondFunction"
```

The call slack list:
- secondFunction // first in

Then:
- firstFunction // last in, first out
- secondFunction

Then: 
- empty

### Slack overflow
calling a function inside itself (just like infinite loops)

## JavaScrip Errors

1. Reference errors
2. Syntax errors
3. Range errors
4. Type errors

### Debugging and Handling Errors
The best way is to use `console.log()` or by putting a `debugger;` statement at th line of code you want to break.

*Don't forget to remove all `debugger;` lines before ACP*
