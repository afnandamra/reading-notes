# JavaScript

### How JS makes web pages more interactive?
1. Access the content of the page.
2. Modify the content of the page.
3. Program rules or instructions the browser can follow.
4. React to events triggered by the user or browser.

* **A script** is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in order to achieve a goal.
    * to write a script, you first need to have a goal to achieve, and steps to follow, after that you can start writing your script.
* **An expression** is the result of a single value, which can be assigned or returned using operators (+, -, /, *, ++, --, %).
* **A function** is a way for you to reuse a set of statements or a script you assign to a function.
    * Declaring a function:
        ```JavaScript
            function functionName() {
            function code;
            }
        ```
    * Calling a function:
        ```JavaScript
            functionName();
        ```
    * If a function needs or has information, it goes between the brackets ().
