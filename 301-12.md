# EJS Partials

### When to use
Partials are good to use when you have HTML element that you'll reuse across multiple views (like header, footer, navbar)

### How to use
In the files you want to use this element you add it like this:

```ejs
<%- include( PARTIAL_FILE ) %>
```

### Why use partials
using partials makes it easier to track and modify your elements making sure they're still the same across all your pages.
