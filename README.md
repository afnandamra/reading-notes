### Growth mindset

A growth mindset is the one that love learning, doesn't see talent and intelligence as fixed given traits, just a good **starting points** to be developed. 

##### A growth mindset have signs:
* Embraces challenges
* Presist obstacles
* Makes effort
  * *no pain, no gain*
* Learns from criticism 
* Is inspired by the success of others

#### Reminders to myself

1. Nothing great happens easily, you should face every challange you have and do your best.
2. Learn how to develop yourself and how to listen to those who criticise you.
3. Your success won't do bad to anyone as their success won't do you any bad.
