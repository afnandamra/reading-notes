# JavaScript

### How JS makes web pages more interactive?
1. Access the content of the page.
2. Modify the content of the page.
3. Program rules or instructions the browser can follow.
4. React to events triggered by the user or browser.

* **A script** is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in order to achieve a goal.
* **An object** can have its own:
    * Properties.
    * Events.
    * Methods.
* **A function** is a way for you to reuse a set of statements or a script you assign to a function.
    * Declaring a function:
        ```JavaScript
            function functionName() {
            function code;
            }
        ```
    * Calling a function:
        ```JavaScript
            functionName();
        ```
    * If a function needs or has information, it goes between the brackets ().
