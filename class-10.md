# JavaScript
## Debugging

* **Debugging** is the process of finding errors.
    * The main way to track and find (or narrow down) an error is by using the console.
    * JavaScript has 7 nain types of errors:
        1. RangeError (calling an array index that in larger than its length).
        2. ReferenceError (not defined variables).
        3. SyntaxError.
        4. TypeError.
        5. URIError (Uniform Resource Indicator).
        6. EvalError.
        7. InternalError, like infinite loops.
    * to find and handle errors correctly in your code you need to understand JS excution context and stacks.
