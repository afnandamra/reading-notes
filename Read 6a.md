## JavaScript

- How JS works with HTML and CSS and how the site is different with each.
  - HTML gives your site a structre
  - CSS changes how your site appears.
  - JS changes how the site interacts with users.

- There is a sample on how to add JS to your webpage as we did in this repo: [Class-06-JS](https://afnandamra.github.io/Class-06-JS/)

- We learned some JS:
    - `document.write('Welcome!');`
    - you can add JS to HTML using `<script>` tag.
    - variables `var name;`
    - Data types in JS:
        - Numeric
        - String
        - Boolean
