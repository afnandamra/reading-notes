# Responsive Web Design

**Responsive web design:** is the practice of building a website suitable to work on every device and every screen size, no matter how large or small, mobile or desktop.

### Responsive vs. Adaptive vs. Mobile
**Responsive** generally means to react quickly and positively to any change.
**Adaptive** means to be easily modified for a new purpose or situation, such as change.
**Mobile** generally means to build a separate website commonly on a new domain solely for mobile users.

Responsive web design is broken down into three main components, which are:
#### 1. Flexible Layouts
It is the practice of building the layout of a website with a flexible grid, using relative length units (mostly percentage or em), that are capable of dynamically resizing to any width.

**Relative Viewport Lengths**
* vw: viewports width.
* vh: viewports height.
* vmin: Minimum of the viewport’s height and width.
* vmax: Maximum of the viewport’s height and width.

```target ÷ context = result * 100%```

#### 2. Media Queries

**Initializing Media Queries**
1. using the @media rule inside of an existing style sheet. (recommended)
2. importing a new style sheet using the @import rule.
3. linking to a separate style sheet from within the HTML document.

**Media Queries:** all, screen(default), print, tv, 3d-glasses, and braille. We can use logical operators with them: and, not, and only.

```css
@viewport {
  width: device-width;
  zoom: 1;
}
```

#### 3. Flexible Media

```css
img, video, canvas {
  max-width: 100%;
}
```

Embedded media should have a parent element with a relative position, height = 0, and width = 100%. And the embedded media `<iframe>` should have absolute position, 100% height and 100% width.
